<p>Once upon a time, in a comfortable pine forest far away from the furthest reaches of society, there lived a quaint old man and his faithful dachshund,<br/> 
whose name was Weinerschnitzel. Now, the old man was growing decidedly advanced in his age, and his eyesight had begun to decline as a result. <br/><br/>

"Weinerschnitzel!" he would call. "Fetch me my glasses, Weinerschnitzel, for the love of Dog, I cannot see!"<br/><br/>

And good old Weinerschnitzel would fetch. The dachshund was a stalwart companion, and the old man came to make liberal use of his hound's reliability.<br/><br/>

The years passed, however, and the old man's eyesight continued to decline. But he was not unduly worried, for, after all, Weinerschnitzel kept him<br/>
company. Even when time robbed him of his eyesight completely and death knocked impatiently upon his front door, the old man was content. He had<br/>
lived a full and colorful life, not described at all in this short story. One thing, however, still bothered him. How would good old Weinerschnitzel<br/>
survive without him? Surely a slow and agonizing death was the only thing that awaited the dog, alone in that shaded pine forest. There was one last<br/>
thing that he must do, he decided.<br/><br/>

"Weinerschnitzel!" he calls. "Come here for a moment!"<br/><br/>

The dachshund trots over amicably, dark eyes eager.<br/><br/>

The old man pats the dog kindly and picks him up with arms like dessicated twigs. His jaws open wide. A sharp crack is heard as his jaws<br/>
unhinge, revealing rows upon rows of steel fangs. The dog whimpers, confused, but it is too late. The bear trap closes conclusively over the dog's<br/>
head, snapping through fur and flesh and spinal cord in one clean crush. Weinerschnitzel's blood sprays across the room, staining a previously<br/>
rustic setting that was not described earlier. The addition of red, unceremoniously splattered across various pieces of furniture, doesn't do too badly.<br/>
You look back at the old man. He grins maliciously at you. His steel teeth, coated with the fresh juices of Weinerschnitzel, have lost their shine,<br/>
you notice. How is he going to get it all off, you wonder. Denture cleaning solution, maybe?<br/><br/>

"You thought it was all going to end well, didn't you?!" he screeches, waving Weinerschnitzel's decapitated body at you. Bits of gore fly across<br/>
the room that you didn't know you were standing in. "Well you were right! This ends very well! For ME!"<br/><br/>

He lunges at you...</p>
